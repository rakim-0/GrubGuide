1. Split cart table into two.
    orders
        id (primary key, unique identifier for each order)
        cart_id (foreign key referencing the cart table)
        user_id (foreign key referencing the users table)
        subtotal
        total_price
        total_taxes
        total_shipping
        total_discount_percentage
        created_at (timestamp for when the order was placed)
        updated_at (timestamp for when the order was last updated)

    order_items
        id (primary key, unique identifier for each order item)
        cart_id (foreign key referencing the cart table)
        dish_id (foreign key referencing the dishes table)
        quantity
        price_at_purchase (price of the dish when it was added to the cart)
        created_at (timestamp for when the item was added to the cart)
        updated_at (timestamp for when the item was last updated)
        
2. Generate random userId and add to localStorage. Replace it when user logs in.
    when should I store the userId in mysql table?
    also should I store the email and phone number in local storage until order is placed?

3. Cart should be updated with small bubble number. Store the number in local storage.
4. Redesign Cart Page so cart groups dishes by restaurant

5. Implement API-Pagination.
6. Randomly Generate data for restaurant.
7. Implement elasticsearch
